# GlobalNetwork module
# This module allows you to send messages (objects) between servers independently of other proxies.
# To connect servers into a network, assign a port under which the plugin will receive sent packets
# and enter a list of servers with the IP address and port assigned in the plugin config on another server,
# data will be sent to these addresses.
# Pattern for assigning a server to a server list: name@host:port
#
# ATTENTION! PORTS MUST BE FREE, I.E. NO SERVICES CAN USE THESE PORTS - THEY ARE RESERVED ONLY FOR COMMUNICATION VIA THIS PLUGIN.
# THIS MEANS THAT YOU CANNOT ASSIGN A PORT HERE, E.G. YOUR SERVER.
